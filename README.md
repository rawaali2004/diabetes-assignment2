# Diabetes Classification

This task uses the Diabetes dataset from Kaggle which contains health information of individuals
including features like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, age, and others.
The goal is to analyze these health indicators to build a model that can task the onset of diabetes.

## Machine Learning Problem
This is a classification problem where the target variable indicates whether 
a person has diabetes (1) or not (0). The task is to use the features 
to build and evaluate a classifier that correctly predicts diabetes.
